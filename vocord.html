But sometimes travelers want to write a note to describe how the moment was. Travelers already spend a lot of time for taking photos. If they type the note, travelers need to ‘see’ the screen instead of seeing the scenery. However, with voice recording, travelers can see the wonderful scenery while they recording the moment.</p><img src="images/1_1.jpg" srcset="images/1_1-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/1_1-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/1_1-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/1_1.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" id="w-node-63e18a8cadc3-4d737394" alt="">

I share my writings and photo through SNS with people. I want to deliver my vivid experience to the reader. I used to take pictures with the camera. But I just take pictures with my phone these days. Because the camera is heavier and takes time to share the photo in SNS. I want to enjoy the scenery out of the screen. Therefore, I take many pictures with my phone. Sometimes, there are too many same pictures so I send a lot of time to delete similar pictures. And I need to organize my photo as soon as possible. Otherwise, I forget where is it and why I took the photo. Also, when I need to write a caption, I don’t know what to write because time already passed and I don’t know how to write the best caption for my photos.</p><img src="images/woman.png" id="w-node-e7b58ec8b70b-4d737394" alt="">

    <p id="w-node-2422a39bc851-4d737394" class="paragraph-13">Power of the sound<br>‍<br>Among the five senses which refer to the five traditionally recognized methods of perception: taste, sight, touch, smell, and sound, the sight affect people a lot. Most of the media platforms are photos, videos, and texts.  I rarely had recorded the voice with a smartphone before. I was familiar with media platforms such as photo, video, and text which are visible.  However, after I used voice message with Wechat with my friend, I find out precious moment of voice recording. <br><br>‍<br> Benefits of Voice recording<br>‍<br>1. People can capture the moment with the voice. <br>2. Voice recording delivers emotions and feelings which text or photo can&#x27;t <br>3. While recording the voice, surrounding sound such as traffic sound, friend&#x27;s laughing sound, music sound also can be saved. <br>4. People don&#x27;t need to see the screen to record. <br>5. People can create contents very fast. I try to apply the benefits of voice recording for travelers.<br><br>‍<br>From my experience<br>‍<br>I went to travel with friends. Of course, we took photos a lot during travel. We all had Instagram and everyone uploaded the photos they like.<br>However, none of us uploaded the photos right after we took it. After our tight schedule of the day or before going to bed, we started to pick the best photo and did photoshop. After editing the photo, we finally shared the exciting moment through Instagram. However, some of the photos, I couldn&#x27;t remember why I took photos of that moment. Next day, I was trying to write a note for the photo. But it took times and I kept focusing on typing instead of seeing the view.  At this point, my idea was started and I developed it.</p>
